# Deductive-Fault-Simulator
DESCRIPTION

  This Deductive Fault Simulator can be used for 2 purposes:
  1. To analyse the circuit by checking the faults detected for individual test vectors. Gives a list of faults detected and the fault coverage for the given inputs.
  2. To find out the number of test vectors required to achieve a given fault coverage

  For every location, both s-a-0 and s-s-1 faults are considered. The fault locations can be chosen in 5 different ways:
1. At Primary inputs.
2. At Primary outputs.
3. At Gate outputs.
4. At Primary inputs and Primary outputs.
5. At Primary inputs, Primary outputs and Gate outputs.

STEPS

1. Put the text file containing the circuit in the same folder as that of the code.
2. Enter the filename without .txt.
3. Proceed further based on the options you select.
